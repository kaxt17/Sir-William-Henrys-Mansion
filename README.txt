•How well does the game accomplish what you set out to do?
	By making this game, I was able to try something new in inform which was making the illusion of rooms moving around.

•Discuss a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck.
	I got stuck essentially every time I got an error message.  The error messages in inform were very unclear and they provided me no help in figuring out what was wrong with my code, so I had to try to try different things until it worked.

•Describe each of three puzzles in your game and how to solve each puzzle.
	1.  Finding the pin in the record player. You need to find the reader pin and put it in the record player to make the record player playable.
	2.  You need to play records that you find to open up more locations to explore and find more records to play.  
	3.  Ask the ghost about getting out.  You need to ask the ghost how to get out so you can leave the house and win


•Discuss the gameplay mechanics in your game and how they improve the user's experience.
	The “Moving rooms” is a mechanic I used in this game that I created to let the player have a little bit of control over the map.  They can play the records so they move room so they can enter the rooms.
		
•Discuss the beta testing process: Who tested your game? 
	I let my sister beta test my game because she had no experience with interactive fiction 
	
•How did their feedback affect your game? 
	I realized that my game didn’t explain enough about certain things so it wasn’t obvious what to do.  For instance, I didn’t write what direction were available to go in so people were confused.

•Whose game did you beta test? 
	I beta tested Chris’ game.

•What feedback were you able to give?
	I was able to give feedback about how certain things in the game weren’t described enough so you might not think of someone doing certain things in the game.
	
•What are you most proud of?
	I am most proud of the fact that I was able to write all my code during this time and most of it works despite having many challenges with the error messages in inform.

•What would you do differently next time?
	I would try ask for help more frequently because inform is definitely not easy to pick up and it is not very clear to beginners.
